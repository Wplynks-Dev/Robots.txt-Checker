# Robots.txt-Checker
The "Robots.txt Checker" is a Chrome browser extension designed to help users quickly and easily inspect the contents of a website's robots.txt file. The robots.txt file is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and search engine robots, specifying which parts of the site can be crawled or indexed and which should be excluded.
Key Features:

User-Agent and Rules: The extension extracts and displays the following information from the robots.txt file:

List of User-Agents: Identifies the user agents (bots) that are mentioned in the file.
List of Allow Rules: Displays rules that specify what the identified user agents are allowed to access on the website.
List of Disallow Rules: Displays rules that specify what the identified user agents are not allowed to access on the website.
Usage:

Users can use this extension to gain insights into how a particular website instructs web crawlers and search engine bots regarding access to its content. It's particularly useful for web developers, SEO professionals, and anyone interested in understanding a website's crawling and indexing policies.

By providing a clear breakdown of user agents and associated rules, the extension offers a user-friendly way to interpret and analyze the robots.txt files of websites.

Note: Respect website terms of service and be aware that the information provided by the robots.txt file may vary from site to site.
